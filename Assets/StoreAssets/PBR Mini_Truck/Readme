Thank you for downloading the PBR Mini Truck Vehicle, we hope you will like it!

In this package you will find:
-The Mini Truck fbx (1320 tris) and a lower poly collider.
-4 1024x1024 albedo (color variations), 1 ambient occlusion, 1 normal map, 1 specular textures for the vehicle itself.
-1 512x512 albedo, ambient occlusion, normal map, specular textures for the wheels.
-a wheel FBX (240 tris) if you want to use on other vehicles.
-2 prefabs (one including the unity car controller, another "naked").

The material should be used in a specular setup. Just drag the textures in the correct slots in the standard unity shader (specular setup).

The Car scripts and the Audio from the driving scene are all from the Standard Assets Pack.
